Title: Implement "Join a Team" Functionality in User Registration

Description:
Enhance the user registration process to allow new users to optionally join an existing team by providing a unique Team Join Code.

Requirements:

Registration Form Enhancement:

Add an optional input field for "Team Join Code" to the registration form.

Backend Validation & Processing:

When a user submits the registration form:

If a join code is provided:

Validate the provided code against existing teams stored in the database.

If the code is valid:

Associate the user with the corresponding team (e.g., by adding a record in a join table if using a many-to-many relationship).

Optionally, update the team's member list or other team-related metadata.

If the code is invalid:

Return a clear and user-friendly error message indicating that the join code is invalid.

If no join code is provided:

Proceed with the normal registration flow without team association.

Database Considerations:

Ensure that the database schema supports team membership (e.g., via a teams table and a user_teams join table if users can belong to multiple teams).

If necessary, create database migrations or update existing schemas to accommodate this new functionality.

Security & Data Integrity:

Ensure proper validation to prevent unauthorized access or invalid team associations.

Handle errors and edge cases gracefully to maintain data integrity.

Testing & Documentation:

Write unit tests to cover:

Successful team join with a valid code.

Handling of invalid or non-existent join codes.

Behavior when no join code is provided.

Include inline comments and update documentation to explain the new functionality and any changes made to the registration workflow.

Acceptance Criteria:

The registration form includes a "Team Join Code" field.

A valid join code results in the user being associated with the appropriate team.

An invalid join code returns an appropriate error message without completing registration.

All changes are well-documented and covered by unit tests.
