2025-05-02T13:29:18Z error: The deployment is failing health checks. This can happen if the application isn't responding, responds with an error, or doesn't respond in time. Health checks are sent to the / endpoint by default and must respond as soon as possible. Make sure that the / endpoint is implemented and returns a 200 status code in a timely manner. Avoid doing expensive or long running operations on the / endpoint, prefer deferring them to a different route. Check the logs for more information.
