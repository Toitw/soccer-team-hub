Generate everything needed (backend + frontend) to add the following flow to the web app “Cancha +”.

### 1. Minimal Sign‑Up
▪ Single screen with these fields  
  – firstName, lastName  
  – email (unique, validated)  
  – password (hashed)  
  – role  ["PLAYER", "COACH", "ADMIN"]      // only ADMIN may create teams  
  – teamCode (optional string)  

Business rules  
• If teamCode is supplied and exists, link user to that team and set onboardingCompleted = true.  
• Otherwise create the user without a team and set onboardingCompleted = false.

### 2. First‑Login Onboarding Wizard  
Shown only when onboardingCompleted == false.  
It offers three mutually exclusive actions:

1. **Join an Existing Team**  
   • Input teamCode → on success, link user and finish onboarding.

2. **Create a New Team** (only for role === "ADMIN")  
   • 3‑step sub‑wizard:  
     a) **Basic Details**  
        – teamName  
        – category (enum: "PROFESSIONAL", "FEDERATED", "AMATEUR")  
          *Alt suggestion:* "ELITE", "REGIONAL", "GRASSROOTS" — pick whichever fits better.  
        – **teamType** (suggested label: “Game Format”)  
          values: "11‑a‑side", "7‑a‑side", "Futsal"  
        – optional logo  
     b) **Invite Step**  
        – auto‑generate a short teamCode + shareable inviteLink  
   • After creation, mark onboardingCompleted = true for the creator.

3. **Skip for Now**  
   • Send the user to /dashboard.  
   • Dashboard shows mock/sample data in every menu option (dashboard/team/matches/events/statistics/announcements/configuration) and a persistent banner: “Complete your team setup to start using Cancha +”.


### 3. Front‑End Flow (high level)
• After login/registration, call /me.  
• If onboardingCompleted == false → redirect to /onboarding wizard.  
• When wizard finishes, set the flag locally and route to /dashboard.  
• If the user skips, render the dashboard with mock data and the reminder banner until a real team is selected or created.
