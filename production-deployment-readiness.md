# Production Deployment Readiness Checklist

## Environment Variables
- ✅ Created centralized environment variable validation using Zod
- ✅ Made non-critical variables optional (SENDGRID_API_KEY, FRONTEND_URL)
- ✅ Added proper error handling for missing critical variables

## Database Connection
- ✅ Using @neondatabase/serverless with proper WebSocket configuration
- ✅ Configured connection pooling with appropriate timeouts and retry settings
- ✅ Added health check endpoint that confirms database connection before responding

## Session Management
- ✅ Replaced MemoryStore with PostgreSQL session store using connect-pg-simple
- ✅ Added session cleanup and expiration settings
- ✅ Used secure cookie settings in production environments

## Authentication & Security
- ✅ Using Argon2id for password hashing (recommended by OWASP)
- ✅ Added backward compatibility for legacy password formats
- ✅ Implemented proper CSRF protection
- ✅ Added rate limiting for authentication endpoints

## Error Handling & Logging
- ✅ Added structured logging with proper context for all errors
- ✅ Improved error messages and status codes
- ✅ Implemented global error handler
- ✅ Added custom route for authentication debugging

## Testing & Verification
- ✅ Created test endpoints to verify functionality
- ✅ Tested full authentication flow, session persistence and state
- ✅ Verified PostgreSQL connection working properly
- ✅ Confirmed session persistence across server restarts

## Pre-Deployment Actions
1. Run database schema validation and migrations
2. Clear any test users created during development
3. Ensure all security headers are properly configured
4. Remove or disable any testing/debugging routes in production

## Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. Set up monitoring for the /healthz endpoint
2. Check logs for any unexpected errors or warnings
3. Verify that database connections are closing properly
4. Monitor session table growth and setup periodic cleanup
