# Match Functionality Fixes - User/Member Reference Resolution

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with substitutions, goals, and cards functionalities that were broken due to database schema expecting team member IDs while the system was providing user IDs.

## Root Cause
The core issue was a mismatch between:
- **Database Schema**: Foreign keys in match-related tables (`match_substitutions`, `match_goals`, `match_cards`) referenced team member IDs
- **Server Logic**: Routes were trying to fetch user data instead of team member data for display

## Changes Made

### 1. Substitutions Functionality ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes.ts` (lines ~570-580)

**Changes:**
- Updated GET `/api/teams/:teamId/matches/:matchId/substitutions` route
- Changed `storage.getUser(substitution.playerInId)` to `storage.getTeamMemberById(substitution.playerInId)`
- Changed `storage.getUser(substitution.playerOutId)` to `storage.getTeamMemberById(substitution.playerOutId)`
- Removed password filtering since team members don't have passwords

### 2. Goals/Scorer Functionality ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes.ts` (lines ~545-565)

**Changes:**
- Updated GET `/api/teams/:teamId/matches/:matchId/goals` route
- Changed `storage.getUser(goal.scorerId)` to `storage.getTeamMemberById(goal.scorerId)`
- Changed `storage.getUser(goal.assistId)` to `storage.getTeamMemberById(goal.assistId)` for assists
- Removed password filtering logic

### 3. Cards Functionality ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `server/routes.ts` (lines ~607-620, 632-660)
- `shared/schema.ts` (lines 352-370)
- `client/src/components/match-details.tsx` (lines 102-113, 522-530, 2222)
- Database schema (added `reason` column)

**Changes:**
#### Backend:
- Updated GET `/api/teams/:teamId/matches/:matchId/cards` route to use team members
- Changed `storage.getUser(card.playerId)` to `storage.getTeamMemberById(card.playerId)`
- Added reason field support in POST route
- Fixed card type mapping: frontend `type` field → database `isYellow`/`isSecondYellow` booleans

#### Database:
- Added `reason TEXT` column to `match_cards` table
- Updated schema definition in `shared/schema.ts` to include reason field
- Updated insert schema to include reason field

#### Frontend:
- Updated card form schema to use `type` and `reason` fields instead of `isYellow`/`isSecondYellow`
- Fixed card form default values
- Updated card display to show reason field (was hardcoded to "-")

## Database Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE match_cards ADD COLUMN reason TEXT;
```

## Key Technical Details

### Card Type Mapping
- **Frontend**: Uses `type` field with values "yellow", "red", "second_yellow"
- **Database**: Uses boolean fields `isYellow` and `isSecondYellow`
- **Mapping Logic**:
  ```javascript
  const isYellow = type === "yellow" || type === "second_yellow";
  const isSecondYellow = type === "second_yellow";
  ```

### Team Member vs User Data
- **Before**: Routes fetched user data with password filtering
- **After**: Routes fetch team member data (which includes fullName, jerseyNumber, etc.)
- **Benefit**: Direct access to team-specific member information without user account complexity

## Testing Results
All functionality tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Substitutions display player names correctly
- ✅ Goals show scorer and assist names correctly  
- ✅ Cards show correct type (yellow/red) and display custom reasons
- ✅ All CRUD operations (create, read, delete) working for all three features

## Files Modified Summary
1. `server/routes.ts` - Updated 3 GET routes and 1 POST route
2. `shared/schema.ts` - Added reason field to matchCards schema
3. `client/src/components/match-details.tsx` - Updated card form and display logic
4. Database - Added reason column to match_cards table

## Impact
- **Performance**: Improved by removing unnecessary user lookups
- **Data Consistency**: Aligned frontend expectations with database schema
- **User Experience**: All match event functionalities now work as expected
- **Maintainability**: Simplified data flow by using consistent team member references

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - All substitutions, goals, and cards functionalities are fully operational.
