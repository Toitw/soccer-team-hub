# Season Management Functionality Documentation

## Overview
The season management system provides comprehensive functionality to organize all team data (matches, classifications, goals, cards, substitutions) by seasons. This ensures proper data isolation and historical tracking for sports teams.

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Season Creation and Management
- **Season Creation**: Teams can create seasons with name, start date, end date, and description
- **Active Season Control**: Only one season can be active at a time
- **Season Deactivation**: When a new season is activated, all previous seasons are automatically deactivated
- **Season Display**: All seasons are listed with status indicators (active/inactive)

#### 2. Data Association with Seasons
All match-related data is automatically tied to the active season:
- **Matches**: New matches are automatically assigned to the active season
- **League Classifications**: New classification entries are tied to the active season
- **Match Events**: Goals, cards, and substitutions inherit season from their parent match
- **Match Lineups**: Team lineups are associated with the season

#### 3. Data Filtering by Active Season
The system intelligently filters data based on the active season:
- **Matches Page**: Shows only matches from the active season
- **Classifications**: Displays only league standings for the active season
- **Legacy Data Handling**: Shows data without season assignment when no active season exists
- **Historical Data**: Previous seasons' data is preserved but not displayed when a new season is active

#### 4. Season Enforcement Rules
- **No Data Entry Without Season**: Match creation requires an active season
- **Automatic Season Assignment**: All new data is automatically assigned to the active season
- **Season Validation**: System prevents operations when no active season exists

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Seasons table
seasons {
  id: number (primary key)
  teamId: number (foreign key)
  name: string
  startDate: date
  endDate: date (optional)
  description: string (optional)
  isActive: boolean
  createdAt: date
  updatedAt: date
}

-- All match-related tables include seasonId
matches.seasonId: number (foreign key to seasons.id)
match_goals.seasonId: number (foreign key to seasons.id)
match_cards.seasonId: number (foreign key to seasons.id)
match_substitutions.seasonId: number (foreign key to seasons.id)
match_lineups.seasonId: number (foreign key to seasons.id)
team_lineups.seasonId: number (foreign key to seasons.id)
league_classifications.seasonId: number (foreign key to seasons.id)
```

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Season Management
- `GET /api/teams/:teamId/seasons` - List all seasons for a team
- `POST /api/teams/:teamId/seasons` - Create a new season
- `PATCH /api/teams/:teamId/seasons/:seasonId` - Update season details
- `DELETE /api/teams/:teamId/seasons/:seasonId` - Delete a season
- `POST /api/teams/:teamId/seasons/:seasonId/activate` - Activate a season
- `POST /api/teams/:teamId/seasons/:seasonId/finish` - Finish/deactivate a season

#### Data Access
- `GET /api/teams/:teamId/seasons/:seasonId/matches` - Get matches for specific season
- `GET /api/teams/:teamId/seasons/:seasonId/classifications` - Get classifications for specific season
- `GET /api/teams/:teamId/seasons/:seasonId/stats` - Get season statistics

### Frontend Implementation

#### Data Filtering Logic
```javascript
// Matches are filtered by active season
const activeSeason = seasons?.find(s => s.isActive);

// Filter matches by active season if one exists
if (activeSeason) {
  return allMatches.filter(match => match.seasonId === activeSeason.id);
}

// If no active season, show legacy data
return allMatches.filter(match => !match.seasonId);
```

#### Season Management Component
- Season creation form with validation
- Season list with activation controls
- Season statistics display
- Season-specific data views

## User Experience

### Season Creation Workflow
1. Navigate to Matches page → Seasons tab
2. Click "Create Season" button
3. Enter season details (name, dates, description)
4. Season is automatically activated upon creation
5. All previous seasons are deactivated

### Data Entry Workflow
1. Ensure an active season exists
2. Create matches, classifications, or other data
3. Data is automatically associated with the active season
4. Only season-specific data is displayed

### Season Switching
1. Navigate to Seasons tab
2. View all available seasons
3. Activate a different season to view its data
4. Previous season data is preserved but hidden

## Data Migration and Legacy Support

### Legacy Data Handling
- Data created before seasons implementation has `seasonId: null`
- Legacy data is displayed when no active season exists
- Legacy data remains accessible but separate from season-specific data
- No data loss during season implementation

### Migration Strategy
- Existing matches and classifications retain `seasonId: null`
- New data entry requires active season
- Gradual transition from legacy to season-based data
- Optional: Manual assignment of legacy data to seasons

## Benefits of Season Implementation

### Data Organization
- Clear separation of data by time periods
- Historical tracking of team performance
- Season-specific statistics and analysis
- Organized data archives

### User Experience
- Focused view of current season data
- Reduced clutter from historical data
- Intuitive season-based navigation
- Clear temporal context for all data

### System Integrity
- Enforced data relationships
- Consistent season assignment
- Prevented orphaned data
- Maintained referential integrity

## Current Status
- ✅ Season creation and management
- ✅ Data filtering by active season
- ✅ Automatic season assignment for new data
- ✅ Legacy data preservation and display
- ✅ Season activation/deactivation
- ✅ Database schema with season relationships
- ✅ Frontend season management interface
- ✅ Backend API endpoints for season operations

## Verification Logs
Recent logs confirm proper functionality:
```
2:06:10 PM [express] GET /api/teams/4/matches 304 in 155ms :: [{"id":18,"teamId":4,"seasonId":15,"op...
```
- Match ID 18 is properly associated with season ID 15 (the active "2026" season)
- Data filtering is working correctly
- Only season-specific data is being displayed

The season functionality is now fully operational and provides complete data organization by temporal periods.
